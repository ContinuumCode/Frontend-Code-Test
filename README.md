# Continuum - Frontend Coding Assessment


## Brief

1.	The assessment is split into two exercises, try to fully complete each part but if you get stuck move on to the next part.
2.	The framework to be used is Bootstrap Version 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/)
3.	All icons used should be from font awesome (https://fontawesome.com/)
4.	In terms of fonts feel free to use the font of your choice in the exercises.
5.	Where Javascript is required you are free to write in vanilla Javascript or use jQuery.
6.	The completed code should match the concepts below as much as possible, we understand there may be differences between the font used in the concept and the font file and this is ok.
7.	If you have any questions about the assessment please email us before you start.
8.	We would like to see how long it takes to complete the assessment so please use this timing tool (https://toggl.com/) and record your time for each exercise. Please send us back a screenshot of your dashboard time.



### Exercise One:

Replicate this layout and design through only HTML and CSS (No JS). Use of HTML5 and CSS3 standards are a plus:

### Exercise Two:

Recreate a single page with the following requirements:

1.	Header with Nav, Logo, Contact links and Search Bar (This does not need to be functional)
2.	Banner Slider – Please use a jQuery slider such as slick slider here. You will be tested on how clean your code functions and reads. A minimum of 3 images are required. Any images can be used.
3.	Services Blocks x 2 (Buttons do not need to be functional and don’t need to redirect.
4.	Logo/Portfolio Slider – Please use Javascript or jQuery here and it must show 4 images when loaded. You can also use sliders such as slick slider here. Any images can be used.
5.	News Tiles – These should be replicated as seen in the screenshot. When scaling to mobile, they should stack.

Please see concept below or view in concept folder:

### Requirements

1.	All HTML, CSS, & Javascript should be well commented and comments should be written in a non-technical manner.
2.	The code should be fully tested for all contexts (Mobile, Tablet & Desktops), see browser list below. Everything should be responsive.
3.	Validate all the code written using https://validator.w3.org/
4.	Make sure to focus on writing clean code and reusable code.
5.	When submitting the task please create a separate folder for each exercise in the format of: exercise-one and include any files and assets needed.
6.	If you get stuck at any part don't worry and get through as much of it as you can. This test is to see how you perform with certain tasks and to find out what skill level you are at. If you can’t complete something, move on to the next part and come back to it later. If you don’t complete it by the submission time, that’s ok. Do as much as you can.


### Bonus

If you would like to add some extra spice to the completed exercise try some of the below suggestions.
Note: this is optional, so don’t feel like you need to do them if you run out of time.

1.	Use a build tool to create the end solutions (e.g. gulp/grunt)
2.	Write the CSS using SCSS (Please include your source folder with all .scss files)
3.	Write any Javascript function in ES6
4.	Use GIT to show your commits and your approach to the test. Please link to your repository.
